Hi i'm theki. I like to write code because the things i create amuse me. Most of my repositories are solo projects where I'm the only contributor.

# Languages i know
These include markup languages aswell

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Markdown
- Lua
- Ruby
- Java
- APL (sorta)
- C++ (sorta)
- Clojure (sorta)

I would not consider 6502 ASM to be a "language" that you can "learn" ( as it is dead simple ) but I do know my way around the 6502 and its respective assembly language.

# Languages I want to know

- Lisp
- Raku
- CoffeeScript
- SCSS
- C#
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Python
