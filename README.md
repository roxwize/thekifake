Hi i'm theki. I like to write code because the things i create amuse me. Most of my repositories are solo projects where I'm the only contributor.

# Programming languages i know
Sorted from most experienced to least experienced, probably

- JavaScript
- Lua
- C#

I would not consider 6502 ASM to be a "language" that you can "learn" ( as it is dead simple ) but I do know my way around the 6502 and its respective assembly language.

# Languages I want to know

- Lisp
- Raku
- CoffeeScript
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Python
