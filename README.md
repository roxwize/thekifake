Hi i'm theki. I like to write code because the things i create amuse me. Most of my repositories are solo projects where I'm the only contributor.

# Languages i know
These include markup languages aswell

| Language | Level |
| :------- | ----: |
| HTML | Expert |
| JavaScript | Expert |
| CSS | Advanced |
| Lua | Advanced |
| Ruby | Advanced |
| C# | Intermediate |
| C++ | Intermediate |
| Go | Intermediate |
| Java | Intermediate |
| APL | Beginner 
| Clojure | Beginner |

I would not consider 6502 ASM to be a "language" that you can "learn" ( as it is dead simple ) but I do know my way around the 6502 and its respective assembly language.

# Languages I want to know

- Lisp
- Raku
- CoffeeScript
- SCSS
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Python
